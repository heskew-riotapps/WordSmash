 	<string name="full_rules_1">The idea is to score more points than your opponent by forming valid words out of the letters in your tray combined with the letters 
 	    		   on the board.  Letters must be placed on the board in a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.  Letters can played played on top of previously played letters.</string>
   	<string name="full_rules_2">To start the game, the letters of the first word must placed on at least one of the four smiley faces in the middle of the board.  All words must contain 2 or more letters. 
                       The players alternate turns. Each turn after the first (with the exception of skips and swaps) must 
                       place at least one letter next to a previously placed letter on the board, either to the left or right or above or below, OR overlaying 
                       a previously played letter.</string>                
 	<string name="full_rules_3">An overlay is a letter that is played on top of a letter that was placed on the 
                       board in any previous turn.  Just remember that a player must overlay a letter with a different letter.  In other words, one 
                       cannot overlay an \"A\" with another \"A\".  The letters must be different.</string>  
 	<string name="full_rules_4">A player can skip a turn or swap letters.  
                       Swapped letters are returned to the hopper, the hopper is reshuffled, and the amount of swapped letters are pulled out of the hopper
                       and given to the player.  The player\'s turn is then skipped.  Swapping is not allowed after the hopper is empty.</string>  
 	<string name="full_rules_letters_0">The Basics</string>
 	<string name="full_rules_letters_1">The Letters</string>
 	<string name="full_rules_letters_2">105 letters are shuffled and stored in the hopper until they are dispersed into the player\'s trays.  The mix of the first 100 letters is as follows:</string>                      
 	<string name="full_rules_letters_3">The final 5 letters are made up of 4 randomly chosen consonants and 1 randomly chosen vowel (A, E, I, O, or U).  The random letters will 
                        be unique, meaning that the random consonants chosen might be, for example, "P", "R", "K" and "C", but would never be "P", "K", "R", and "R".</string>   
	<string name="full_rules_scoring_1">Scoring</string>
	<string name="full_rules_scoring_2">Each letter has an assigned value as follows:</string>	
	<string name="full_rules_scoring_3">Bonuses</string>	
	<string name="full_rules_scoring_4">The codes on the board represent bonus values that are multiplied times various letter values that 
                            are placed during a turn.  </string>
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_bonus_2l">the value of the individual letter is multiplied by 2. </string>	
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_bonus_3l">the value of the individual letter is multiplied by 3. </string>	
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_bonus_4l">the value of the individual letter is multiplied by 4. </string>	
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_bonus_2w">the value of the word is multiplied by 2. </string>	
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_bonus_3w">the value of the word is multiplied by 3. </string>
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_5">If an overlay is placed on a bonus tile the bonus does not count.  Only the overlay\'s letter value counts.  Other bonus tiles in the same turn 
                                count normally, just not overlays. Just like any other letter, an overlay\'s letter value is calculated as part of the value of the word if 
                                another letter is placed on a 2W or 3W.</string>  
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_6">If more than one word is formed during a turn, bonus tiles values are only assigned to the word that contained the bonus tiles.</string>
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_7">Letter multipliers are calculated before word multipliers when the points are calculated for a turn.
                                If a word lands on more than one word multiplier bonus tile, each bonus multiplier is used to determine the final score.</string>                            
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_smasher_1">Smashers</string>
    <string name="full_rules_scoring_smasher_2">Another way to earn points is to use all 7 letters in your tray in a single turn. If you use 7 letters in a single turn,
                            you\'ve played a smasher, which is worth 40 bonus points.</string>
    <string name="full_rules_finish_1">Win, Lose, or Draw</string>                        
    <string name="full_rules_finish_2">Normally, the game ends when a player uses all of the letters in his or her tray after the hopper has been emptied. 
                            The first player to finish his or her letters gets a bonus value added to his or her score.
                            The bonus is equal to the accumulated value of all of the letters left in all of the opponent\'s tray.  For instance, if you finished out the 
                            letters in your tray (and the hopper was empty) and your opponent still had a "K", a "U", and a "B" left in the tray, a bonus of 15 points would be awarded
                            to the player in addition to the points that the turn earned.  The player with the most points after the bonus is awarded is declared the 
                            winner.  If you and your opponent have the same score, a draw is declared.</string>
    <string name="full_rules_finish_3">If 2 skips in a row happen by each player, the game is automatically stopped and a winner is determined based on the 
                                points already earned by the players.  No bonus points are awarded in this situation.  Again, if you and your opponent have the same score, a draw is declared.</string>
    <string name="full_rules_finish_4">If you concede, your opponent automatically wins, even if you were leading at the time or the score was tied.  
                               If you were leading (or the score was tied) when the concede button was clicked, the opponent\'s score is adjusted to be 1 point higher
                               than the your score, making your opponent the winner.  The same is true in the opposite.  If your opponent concedes, you automatically win, even if your opponent is leading at the time.</string>
